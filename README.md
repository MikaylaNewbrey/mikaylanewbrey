### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MikaylaNewbrey/mikaylanewbrey** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Mikayla Newbrey, a junior undergraduate majoring in Biology at UMass Amherst. I'm committed to enriching my lab skills and developing a better
understanding of bioinformatic analysis methodologies to maintain competence in my role. My interests mainly lie in evolutionary genomics and marine
invasions. I've done some exciting projects at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and am now working in the Molecular Ecology & Conservation lab at UMass
Amherst. Please reach out if you have any questions!
